## Background Reading

Here's some background reading on text as data in economics research. 
You do **not** need to have read this prior to the workshop.
Think of it as further context if you are looking to dig deeper later on.

### Text as Data in R

This is a go-to book for "doing" text analytics in R:

* [Tidy Text Mining with R][tidytext]

### Some Tools We Use in this Workshop

* [VADER: A Parsimonious Rule-Based Model for Sentiment Analysis of Social Media Text](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/14550)
* [`stm`: R Package for Structural Topic Models](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stm/vignettes/stmVignette.pdf) 
* [Training, evaluating, and interpreting topic models](https://juliasilge.com/blog/evaluating-stm/)

### Survey Papers

These readings are designed to provide you with some background on text as data in economics research.
They are a little technical and less "hands on":
