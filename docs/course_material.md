## Background Reading

Here's some background reading on text as data in economics research. 
You do **not** need to have read this prior to the workshop.
Think of it as further context if you are looking to dig deeper later on.

### Survey Papers

These readings are designed to provide you with some background on text as data in economics research.
They are a little technical and less "hands on":
